= kakoune

the kakoune configuration of a crazy witch

= why kakoune?

- emacs is cool, just too big
- vim is cool, i just like kakoune multicursor better
- configuration style is, mwah, chef's kiss beautiful

= sensibilities

- insert mode snippets are fucking FAST and SEXY
- lsp is... SEXY... but slow,,, as fuck
- treesitter is SEXY.... but i dont need fancy highlighting
- speed and mneumonics should be balanced
- modifier keys should generally be avoided

= quality of life

- jk to escape
- tab and s-tab for completion window
- only importing necessary default modules
- <c-w> to delete word (vim instincts)
- switched alt and shift for many keybinds
- moved <a-i> and <a-a> to , and .
- esc clears selections
- <a-;> is now '
- m and M do <c-d> and <c-u>

= user mode

- y for system clipboard
- c for commenting
- t to open yazi filetree
- f now searches entire directory of files
- s does grep search
- w does window mode
-- s splt down
-- v split left
-- hjkl for different window focus
- b does buffer mode
-- n for next
-- p for previous
-- s for buffer search
-- d for buffer delete
- g does git mode
-- a for add
-- A for add all
-- s for status
-- r for reset
-- c for commit
-- C for checkout
-- l for log
-- d for diff

== language mode

these will usually be enabled for specific filetypes,
but they will generally follow this convention

- l does language mode
-- c to compile
-- r to run

= custom scripts

- git signs implementation stolen from hadronized
- highlighting for luau and nushell
- insert mode snippets that steals from kkga and occivink
