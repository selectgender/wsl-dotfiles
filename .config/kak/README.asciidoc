= kakoune

the kakoune configuration of a crazy witch

= why kakoune?

* emacs is cool, just too big
* vim is cool, i just like kakoune multicursor better
* vis is brilliant, i just dont like the lack of feedback
* kak config style is, mwah, chef's kiss beautiful

= sensibilities

* insert mode snippets are fucking FAST and SEXY
* lsp is... SEXY... but slow,,, as fuck
* treesitter is SEXY.... but i dont need fancy highlighting
* speed and mneumonics should be balanced
* modifier keys should generally be avoided

= quality of life

* jk to escape
* tab and s-tab for completion window
* only importing necessary default modules
* <c-w> to delete word (vim instincts)
* did an emacs god-mode and binded v and V to alt and alt-shift shortcuts
** because before that my thumbs contorted in truly terrible ways
** alt is used by GlazeWM anyways
* moved <a-i> and <a-a> to , and .
* esc clears selections
* <a-;> is now '
* q and e are [p and ]p

= user mode

* y for system clipboard
* c for commenting
* t to open yazi filetree
* g opens gitui
* r opens repgrep
* f now searches entire directory of files
* s does grep search
* w does window mode
** s splt down
** v split left
* b does buffer mode
** n for next
** p for previous
** s for buffer search
** d for buffer delete

== language mode

these will usually be enabled for specific filetypes,
but they will generally follow this convention

* l does language mode
** c to compile
** r to run
** a to analyze
** s to serve

= "custom" scripts

* git signs implementation stolen from hadronized
* highlighting for luau and nushell
* insert mode snippets that steals from kkga and occivink
